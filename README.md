# React Udemy course

This is all the code I wrote during the React Udemy course (React Redux + Advanced React and Redux) from Stephen Grider.

###Getting Started###

```
	> npm install
	> npm start
```

###Changing Folders###

Every folder starting with `src-` has a small project. Change the `src-youtube` folder to `src` to view the project in the browser.

###Tests###
Run tests by `npm run test:watch`. Only works with `src-testing` folder.


###Server###

`cd server`

```
	> npm install
	> npm run dev
```
